Introduction (Same as the report)

In this assignment we were tasked with building a model that could classify different music genres. 
We should distinguish between pop and classical songs using two features: liveness and loudness. 
We got a spotify dataset and our goal was to train a machine learning model using logistic regression 
with stochastic gradient descent as the learning algorithm.
